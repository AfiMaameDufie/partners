    desc: "The ongoing Ebola outbreak makes it a priority to map all tracks, pathways, health facilities and other infrastructure in towns and villages serving the borders. There is a severe lack of up-to-date and detailed maps of this area in Uganda available to those involved in the fight to contain the potential outbreak. Please work with those of us on the ground to collect this potentially life-saving information by remotely tracing infrastructure."
