This task will create a basemap of the area in order to help Red Cross teams to plan logistics and prepare for mobile data collection and field mapping in the areas. We will initially focus on these areas of Lilongwe."

  desc: "The American Red Cross is supporting the Haitian Red Cross to extend health services delivery and improve health outcomes by providing the population with equitable access to primary health services. One key element of this strategy is to increase the availability of professional health resources by training and deploying 10,000 ASCP. The Haitian Red Cross seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the services expected of this initiative and to build health resilience capacity at the community levels by leveraging its country-wide network of volunteers."
