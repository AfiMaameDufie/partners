    desc: "Annual flooding and recurring drought have devastating impacts on communities in Southern Africa. In the Zambezi River basin, seasonal weather patterns often result in crop failure, shelter damage, livestock death, soil erosion and increased water and sanitation issues. Since late 2011, the American Red Cross has been working with communities in Binga district, Zimbabwe to identify and mitigate common hazards, as well as implement small-scale resilience projects such as latrine construction to improve household hygiene and building fuel-efficient cookstoves to reduce environmental degradation. At the same time, the American Red Cross is strengthening the capacity of the Zimbabwe Red Cross through trainings and community contingency planning support."

    desc: "Inhabitants of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, are facing some important water access problem, especially in area of recent settlements surrounding the capital. It leads to recurrent water related diseases like typhoid and cholera. MSF is currently working with local authorities in order to improve the water access in the most critical area. In the meantime, health authorities recently recorded cases of Typhoid, and even if cases numbers are still low, they are increasing. In order to help us taking the best decision possible, having the most accurate overview of everything related to water ways, roads and buildings in these areas would be an invaluable asset."
