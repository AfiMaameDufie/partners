    desc: "Since the second half of 2015, the Mopti region and the Douentza area have begun to experience a fairly significant disruption of security by armed groups. The situation and conflict dynamics in the area have already seriously affected the health and humanitarian situation in and around Douentza. The conflict is expected to continue and strengthen, the health system continues to deteriorate and access for aid workers becomes more complicated. The malaria season and annual hunger gap (a period when there is little or no fresh produce available) begins in June. All these coupled factors make the population situation very precarious. Up-to-date maps are essential to know where the population is living, to better plan our resources to reach populations in danger more quickly and to manage the safety of our teams working in the Douentza area in Mali."

    desc: "The Democratic Republic of Congo is a priority country for the Missing Maps project. South Kivu is a province of DRC that, for decades, has faced unceasing humanitarian crises. With constantly changing conflicts, seasonal disease epidemics and a population in constant flux, MSF and other NGOs have permanent presences here. Tchonka is a city (30 km from Lulingu) of 9313 people. The health center covers this locality and also neighboring localities, a total of 15,778 people. It is one of the areas most affected by malaria, both in Lulingu and Tchonka, 38% of all consultations concern malaria. MSF provides support for this disease in both prevention and cure. A network of community health workers is equipped to carry out sensitization and community activities. They diagnose also suspected cases, do management of simple malaria cases and identification and referral of complicated cases. Despite this awareness-raising activities, the number of malaria cases observed in the population remains very high."

    desc: "Since March 2015, a Saudi-led coalition has been fighting anti-government Houthi forces, resulting in widespread destruction, bombing and gun battles. Ordinary people are bearing the brunt of an increasingly brutal conflict. Roughly 14.8 million people currently have no access to healthcare, and more than three million people have fled their homes. Severe water shortages combined with airstrikes, sniper attacks and a fuel blockade have rapidly turned this conflict into a humanitarian crisis. To plan better their activities MSF requests now the mapping of the city of Ad Dahle and surroundings. Currently there is almost no mapping data available over the area."

    desc: "BUILDINGS ONLY mapping, no need to map the roads. An escalation of in security in DRC has led to over 2043 new refugee have entered Uganda between the dates of 3rd and 5th March. This has brought the total number of new arrivals to since 1st January 2018 to 48,105 In a rapidly developing situation such as this, it is vital that accurate and up-to-date mapping information is available to allow UNHCR and partners to respond to needs more effectively and efficiently. The maps that you create in this task will enable sanitation facilities - including latrines, hand washing points and hygiene promotion activities - to be effectively provisioned for the people living there."

    desc: "MSF teams working in Niger state, northern Nigeria, respond to a variety of different health needs. These include emergency response to disease outbreaks across the area. Accurate maps of the area will assist emergency teams with epidemiological analysis, disease surveillance and logistical planning. The Missing Maps project aims to map the most vulnerable places in the world (affected by humanitarian crises: disease epidemics, conflict, natural disasters, poverty, environmental crises). Building on HOT's disaster preparedness projects, the Missing Maps tasks facilitate pre-emptive mapping of priority countries to better facilitate disaster response, medical activities and resource allocation when crises occur."

    desc: "BUILDINGS ONLY mapping, no need to map the roads. We believe in the need to be prepared for the recovery and response of any natural disasters and unpredictable socio-structural changes that may have negative consequences. Earthquakes and then floods are the main disasters that take place in Turkey. We believe it is important to start working from now on mapping and updating the maps continuously. As of 2016, Zeytinburnu has a population of 287897, inhabiting 13 Mahalles (neighbourhoods), and the population density is 24,838 per km2. The area of Zeytinburnu district is 11,31 KM2. It is estimated that there were around 25,000 registered Syrian refugees in the district, according to research was conducted by Migration Policy Workshop (MAGA) operating within Marmara Municipalities Unionâ€™s Center for Urban Policies."
