    desc: "The Philippines is ranked the third most disaster-prone country in the world, consistently experiencing natural disasters like typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions. Currently, many disaster-prone communities within the Philippines are poorly mapped, making it difficult to both prepare for and respond to natural disasters."

    desc: "The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) Philippines, in partnership with the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC), and the Office of Civil Defense (OCD) is leading a new local installation of DisasterAWARE in the Philippines called PhilAWARE. PhilAWARE is a disaster risk reduction and integrated early warning and decision support system that incorporates many data layers from OpenStreetMap. This platform aims to support the unique disaster preparedness and response needs of the Philippines. Through this project, we will be working closely with various stakeholders such as local communities, local government units, academe, and disaster risk management agencies in order to keep the OSM data updated. Pampanga, Philippines is the pilot area for the completion of the base map, which includes mapping the critical infrastructures through the use of OpenStreetMap. Help us map the unmapped in Pampanga today and save lives!"
