    desc: "In the end of August MSF will assist in an Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) campaign in the south of the Ruyingi Province â€“ Health District of Kinyinya in Burundi. During this campaign insecticides will be applied on the inside of dwellings where malaria infected mosquitos rest. As a result the number of mosquitos will go down, which prevents the transition of Malaria. You are requested to digitize all buildings for this mapping project. The buildings you map will be the denominator for the IRS campaign. The data thus needs to be the most accurate as possible! Please map every building that you can see very carefully."

    desc: "MSF is launching a new maternal and child health support program in the health district of Moissala in Chad. The first activity will be a community survey to appreciate more in detail the health conditions of women and children. The mapping will help MSF to have an overview of all households (represented by roofs) and draw a sample of the population to carry out the survey. The data will also help in better programming health activities."
