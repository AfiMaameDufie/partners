    desc: "MSF is launching a new maternal and child health support program in the health district of Moissala in Chad. The first activity will be a community survey to appreciate more in detail the health conditions of women and children. The mapping will help MSF to have an overview of all households (represented by roofs) and draw a sample of the population to carry out the survey. The data will also help in better programming health activities."

    desc: "The Democratic Republic of Congo is a priority country for the Missing Maps project. South Kivu is a province of DRC that, for decades, has faced unceasing humanitarian crises. With constantly changing conflicts, seasonal disease epidemics and a population in constant flux, MSF and other NGOs have permanent presences here.There is no freely available mapping data available for the province, aside from that which has been already generously contributed by the HOT community in response to very specific crises. The Missing Maps has launched the Map South Kivu project to map the entire province, both remotely and through local community mapping."
