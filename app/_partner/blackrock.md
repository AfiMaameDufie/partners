    desc: "Since the second half of 2015, the Mopti region and the Douentza area have begun to experience a fairly significant disruption of security by armed groups. The situation and conflict dynamics in the area have already seriously affected the health and humanitarian situation in and around Douentza. The conflict is expected to continue and strengthen, the health system continues to deteriorate and access for aid workers becomes more complicated. The malaria season and annual hunger gap (a period when there is little or no fresh produce available) begins in June. All these coupled factors make the population situation very precarious."
