    desc: "For every year that a girl is enrolled in school, she is more likely to avoid early marriage and to survive childbirth. She will be less likely to suffer domestic violence, or be trafficked, and will have a higher future income. She will have a smaller, healthier family and will be 50% more likely to immunize her kids. She’ll leave her mark on future generations, as climate scientists rank girls’ education as number six out of 80 actions that can reverse global warming. And she’ll be twice as likely to educate her own girls — keeping the cycle going. Yet despite all these proven economic and societal benefits, across the globe, millions of girls are still excluded from school because of their gender. India is home to one of the largest such populations, with more than 4.1 million girls outside the classroom. Educate Girls are supporting 1.6 million girls in rural India to gain access to education, and you can help them by mapping and validating villages in rural India."
