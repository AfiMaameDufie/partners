    desc: "After the deadly civil war that took place in 2013-2014, the Central African Republic (CAR) enjoyed a period of relative calm. However, tensions between numerous armed groups exploded again at the end of 2016, throwing the country into a renewed spiral of violence. The conflict raged on throughout 2017 and into 2018. Violent attacks in several locations aggravated the already dire health needs of the population, 15 percent of whom - or close to 700,000 people - are displaced."
