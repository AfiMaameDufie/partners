    desc: "The evolving Ebola situation in the DRC makes it a priority to map all tracks, pathways, health facilities and other infrastructure in towns and villages serving the borders. There is a severe lack of up-to-date and detailed maps of this area available to those involved in the fight to contain the potential outbreak."
