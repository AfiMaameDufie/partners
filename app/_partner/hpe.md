    desc: "In the lake basin region of Chad, the influx of the displaced population is exerting pressure over scarce essential resources. This has resulted in a sharp increase of humanitarian needs in food, healthcare and water, hygiene and sanitation for both IDPs and host communities. Moreover, around 780 unaccompanied children require protection, psychosocial support and recreational activities. This is due to increased conflict in South-Western Diffa region of Niger which is part of the lake Chad basin."
